# History of Java

## Java Version History

The history of Java is quite interesting. Initially, Java was designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry. Java was developed by a team known as the **Green Team** at Sun Microsystems and was eventually used for internet programming. The language was developed by **James Gosling**, who is known as the father of Java, and it was officially released in **1995**.

Java was designed with the principles of being **simple, robust, portable, platform-independent, secured, high performance, multithreaded, architecture-neutral, object-oriented, interpreted, and dynamic**.

### Key Events in Java History:

1. **1991**: Java project initiated by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton. Initially designed for embedded systems.
2. **Greentalk** was the original name with `.gt` file extension, later changed to **Oak**.
3. **1995**: Oak was renamed to **Java** due to trademark issues with Oak Technologies.
4. **1995**: Official release of **Java** by Sun Microsystems.
5. **1996**: JDK 1.0 released.

Java was named after **Java coffee**, a type of coffee from Indonesia, reflecting the language's dynamic, lively nature.

# Difference Between JDK and SE Versions (Short)

## Java SE (Standard Edition)
- Core Java platform with libraries and APIs.
- Used for building and running applications.
- Focuses on key features like OOP, collections, networking, etc.

## JDK (Java Development Kit)
- Development toolkit for building Java applications.
- Includes Java SE + tools like compilers, debuggers, and JRE.
- Required by developers to write, compile, and run Java programs.

### Key Differences:
- **Java SE**: Platform for running applications.
- **JDK**: Includes Java SE + development tools for creating applications.
