# Java Keywords
Java keywords are also known as reserved words. Keywords are particular words that act as a key to a code. These are predefined words by Java, so they cannot be used as a variable, object name, or class name.

## List of Java Keywords
A list of Java keywords or reserved words is given below:

- **abstract**: Used to declare an abstract class, which can provide the implementation of the interface and can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
- **boolean**: Declares a variable as a boolean type that can hold true and false values only.
- **break**: Breaks the loop or switch statement, terminating the current flow of the program at specified conditions.
- **byte**: Declares a variable that can hold 8-bit data values.
- **case**: Used with switch statements to mark blocks of text.
- **catch**: Catches exceptions generated by try statements and must be used after the try block.
- **char**: Declares a variable that can hold unsigned 16-bit Unicode characters.
- **class**: Declares a class.
- **continue**: Continues the loop, skipping the remaining code at the specified condition.
- **default**: Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement.
- **do**: Used in control statements to declare a loop that can iterate a part of the program several times.
- **double**: Declares a variable that can hold a 64-bit floating-point number.
- **else**: Indicates the alternative branches in an if statement.
- **enum**: Defines a fixed set of constants. Enum constructors are always private or default.
- **extends**: Indicates that a class is derived from another class or interface.
- **final**: Indicates that a variable holds a constant value, restricting updates to the variable.
- **finally**: Indicates a block of code in a try-catch structure that is always executed, whether an exception is handled or not.
- **float**: Declares a variable that can hold a 32-bit floating-point number.
- **for**: Starts a for loop, executing a set of instructions repeatedly when a condition becomes true.
- **if**: Tests the condition and executes the if block if the condition is true.
- **implements**: Used to implement an interface.
- **import**: Makes classes and interfaces available to the current source code.
- **instanceof**: Tests whether an object is an instance of the specified class or implements an interface.
- **int**: Declares a variable that can hold a 32-bit signed integer.
- **interface**: Declares an interface that can have only abstract methods.
- **long**: Declares a variable that can hold a 64-bit integer.
- **native**: Specifies that a method is implemented in native code using JNI (Java Native Interface).
- **new**: Creates new objects.
- **null**: Indicates that a reference does not refer to anything, removing the garbage value.
- **package**: Declares a Java package that includes classes.
- **private**: An access modifier indicating that a method or variable may be accessed only in the class in which it is declared.
- **protected**: An access modifier that can be accessed within the package and outside the package only through inheritance.
- **public**: An access modifier indicating that an item is accessible anywhere, having the widest scope among all modifiers.
- **return**: Used to return from a method when its execution is complete.
- **short**: Declares a variable that can hold a 16-bit integer.
- **static**: Indicates that a variable or method is a class method, mainly used for memory management.
- **strictfp**: Restricts floating-point calculations to ensure portability.
- **super**: A reference variable used to refer to parent class objects and invoke immediate parent class methods.
- **switch**: Contains a switch statement that executes code based on test value, testing equality against multiple values.
- **synchronized**: Specifies critical sections or methods in multithreaded code.
- **this**: Refers to the current object in a method or constructor.
- **throw**: Used to explicitly throw an exception, mainly for custom exceptions.
- **throws**: Declares an exception that can be propagated with throws.
- **transient**: Used in serialization, indicating that a data member will not be serialized.
- **try**: Starts a block of code that will be tested for exceptions, followed by either a catch or finally block.
- **void**: Specifies that a method does not have a return value.
- **volatile**: Indicates that a variable may change asynchronously.
- **while**: Starts a while loop, iterating a part of the program several times when the number of iterations is not fixed.
